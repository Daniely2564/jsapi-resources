1. Create a registered application in ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise and add a valid referrer URL that will redirect you back to your hosted application after login. For detailed steps, refer to the [Register an OAuth application](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/security-and-authentication/app-authentication/tutorials/create-oauth-credentials-app-auth/) tutorial.
2. Update the `main.js` File:
    - Replace `YOUR_PORTAL_URL` with your actual portal URL to match your OAuth application‚Äôs settings.
    - Copy the Client ID from your registered application and replace the `YOUR_APP_ID` in the `OAuthInfo` object.
    -  ***Note:*** If you have set OAuthInfo's `popup` property to `true`, you'll need to host a callback page on your server. Save the [oauth-callback.html](oauth-callback.html) page in the same folder as your application page. You can optionally change the location or name by setting the OAuthInfo's `popupCallbackUrl` property.

3. Run `npm install` then `npm run dev` to start the app locally.
