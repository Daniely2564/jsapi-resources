# Recenter custom widget with React and Vite

This repo demonstrates creating a custom widget using [@arcgis/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcgis/core) ES modules with [React](https://react.dev/learn) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#community-templates). The widget is a DOM node created in React and then added to the Map using [View UI](https://next.sites.afd.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/view-ui/). This approach provides seamless integration with your preferred component library, and gives you full control over the user experience and component-life cycle so that it fits your unique requirements.

## Get Started

**Step 1** - Run `npm install`

**Step 2** Configure CSS. 

*index.css*

```css
@import 'https://js.arcgis.com/4.27/@arcgis/core/assets/esri/themes/light/main.css';
```

For additional information, see the [Build with ES modules](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/es-modules/) Guide topic in the SDK.
